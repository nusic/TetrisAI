Progress report (4 pages, due Thu Nov 13): Propose a model and an algorithm for tackling your task.
You should describe the model and algorithm in detail and use a concrete example to demonstrate how the model and algorithm work.
Don't describe methods in general; describe precisely how they apply to your problem (what are variables, factors, states, etc.)?
You should also have made a decent amount of progress on implementing the algorithm.

Algorithm: Search algorithm.
Find valid states by using the bulit function "drop".
Drop from every x wise position for every valid rotation.

Validate state by features.
Feature 1: How low the block are placed. (greater y-value)
Feature 2: Is there some holes near the droped teremino
Feature 3: Total rows
Feature 4: Wells
Feature 5: Holes
Feature 6: Hoes

Validate for the current teremino.
Also do this for n next known tereminos and find the best positon.
